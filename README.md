# Program Title (edit this)

Put your program description here.

1. Objective 
    Move your character to the right coloured tile to prevent the evil villain from pouring paint over the world. 

2. Task
    In order to save your world from a complete paint disaster, you must journey through 10 levels. As you climb the levels, it will get harder. This means shorter time limits and more tiles to choose from. To know which is the correct tile, you must read the word and go to a colour. For example, if the word reads red, but the font colour is blue, you must go to the red tile. If you fail to do so or cross the time limit given, the evil villain Loli will pour paint over the world and you will be forced to restart the game. There may be hidden easter eggs that may grant an extra reward so keep an eye out for them!

3. Gameplay Mechanics
    To play the game, you can use your w, a, s, and d key, or your up, down, left, or right arrow to move around. This game is also based in a 1-dimensional play space.

4. Scoring
    There are a total of 10 levels. In order to clear each level, you need to guess the right colour correctly which 
    will reward you with 1 point. Therefore, since there are 10 levels, you will need a total of 10 points.

5. Limitations
    There is a border around the play space. If it is crossed, you will immediately lose.
    There is a time limit at each round. If it is passed, you will immediately lose.
